Angel provides a wealth of functionality out of the box, which makes development faster.
To expedite it even more, install the [Angel CLI](https://github.com/angel-dart/cli).

```bash
$ pub global activate angel_cli
```

You can bootstrap a complete application with one simple command:

```bash
angel init
```

# Running

```bash
# Two ways to boot your application:

# 1. Support for start scripts and additional pre-boot options:
$ angel start

# 2. Faster startup, but not configurable:
$ dart bin/server.dart
```

And that's it! Check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/angel-dart/angel/wiki)
for more in-depth documentation.
