## Full-featured. Full-stack. All that.

[Angel](https://github.com/angel-dart/angel) provides a high-powered solution for developing complete server-side applications with Dart.

To name just a **few** of its features:
  * Fast startup and [hot-reloading](https://github.com/angel-dart/hot)
  * [Dependency injection](https://github.com/angel-dart/angel/wiki/Dependency-Injection)
  * [Strongly-typed ORM](https://github.com/angel-dart/orm)
  * [WebSocket support](https://github.com/angel-dart/websocket)
  * Database-agnostic [services](https://github.com/angel-dart/angel/wiki/Service-Basics)
  * [Service hooks](https://github.com/angel-dart/angel/wiki/Hooks) to augment functionality
  * Cross-platform [validation](https://github.com/angel-dart/validate)
  * An extensive [client library](https://github.com/angel-dart/client)
  * Much more...
  
Angel offers a batteries-included experience specially tuned for full-stack development.
Unlike those built with other frameworks, applications running Angel can share significant amounts of code
between the server and client(s), and bring up MVP's faster than ever before.

With its highly-extensible [plug-in system](https://github.com/angel-dart/angel/wiki/Using-Plug-ins)
and [thorough documentation](https://github.com/angel-dart/angel/wiki), Angel is
both easy to learn and rewarding to master.
